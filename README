# Crontab
Crontab is a basic container for running custom scripts on regular schedules using Cron.

## Usage
This repo contains two images: mecjay12/crontab:2_alpine and mecjay12/crontab:2_debian. You should use Alpine, if possible, as it is a lighter weight container. This repo has no :latest tag!

No variables are strictly required. Set what's relevant and you are good to go. Variables are the same for both Alpine and Debian

| Variable | Default    | Descripton |
|----------|------------|------------|
| SETUP    |            | Commands or script to run before cron, setting up the container/main script. |
| SCRIPT   |            | Main script to run via Cron |
| SCHEDULE |            | Cron standard schedule |
| TZ       | UTC        | Tzdata standard timezone |
| RUN      | cron(d) -f | Command to run to start Cron (becuase it's different in each image). Probably should be left alone. |
